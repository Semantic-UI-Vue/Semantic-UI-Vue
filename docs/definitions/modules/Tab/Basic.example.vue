        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
          the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage along with
          the basic layout of the webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are
          generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS)
          or functionality/ behavior (JavaScript).

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
          the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
          dialects such as SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
          rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled
          programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
          well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
          environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
          Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic
          language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative
          (e.g. functional programming) styles.
