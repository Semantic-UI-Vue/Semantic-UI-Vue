    <h2 is="sui-header">Dogs Roles with Humans</h2>
    <p>
      Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from
      their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body
      language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication
      may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into
      human households and social situations, and these attributes have given
      dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the
      most successful species on the planet today.

    <p>
      The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly
      becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for
      people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting
      police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped
      individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname
      "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs
      are also a source of meat.
